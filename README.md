# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

## Title and Description Generation Feature
This repository now includes a feature to automatically generate titles and descriptions for issues and pull requests. This feature helps to maintain consistency and improve the quality of the repository's content.
